## Release Notes

### v0.5.0 Summary

This release transforms PL-Hub into a fully automated development environment with professional project templates, comprehensive automation tools, and seamless VS Code integration. The focus is on developer productivity through:

1. **Zero-configuration development** - Templates include everything needed
2. **Instant feedback loops** - Watch mode, hot reload, and continuous testing
3. **Production-ready structure** - All templates follow best practices
4. **Natural language code** - All templates use Phase 1 PohLang syntax only

### Migration Guide

**From v0.4.x to v0.5.0:**

1. **New Project Creation**: Now supports templates
   ```bash
   # Old way (still works)
   python plhub.py create my_app
   
   # New way (recommended)
   python plhub.py create my_app --template basic
   python plhub.py create my_cli --template console
   python plhub.py create my_lib --template library
   ```

2. **Automation Tools**: New commands available
   ```bash
   python plhub.py watch      # Build automation
   python plhub.py dev        # Hot reload
   python plhub.py debug      # Debug server
   python plhub.py test --watch  # Test automation
   ```

3. **VS Code Integration**: Automatically generated for new projects
   - `.vscode/tasks.json` - Build, run, test tasks
   - `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations

### Known Issues
- Web template is placeholder for future features
- Debug server requires runtime support (in development)
- Hot reload may not preserve all state types

### Future Plans (v0.6.0)
- Full web framework integration
- Package registry implementation
- Remote debugging support
- Performance profiling tools
- Code coverage reports
